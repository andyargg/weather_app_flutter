## DESCRIPTION
Minimalist weather app developed with Flutter that uses Material Design to display information, including the city, temperature, current condition, and a representative animation made with Lottie.
The app follows a modular architecture, dividing responsibilities into Models for handling data (weather_model.dart), Services for managing API interactions (weather_service.dart), and Pages for the user interface (weather_page.dart), with main.dart serving as the entry point.
